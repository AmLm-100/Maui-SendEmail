### Code Explanation

This code snippet is part of a .NET MAUI application. It demonstrates how to send an email and display a confirmation alert to the user.

#### MainPage Class

```csharp
public MainPage()
{
    InitializeComponent();
}
```

- **MainPage Constructor**: Initializes the components of the MainPage. This is typically where UI elements are set up.

#### OnCounterClicked Method

```csharp
private async void OnSendClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    await SendEmailAsync();
    // Display an alert to the user after the email is sent
    await DisplayAlert("Email Sent", "Your email has been sent successfully.", "OK");
}
```

- **OnCounterClicked**: This is an event handler that gets triggered when a button (or any UI element) is clicked.
  - **await SendEmailAsync()**: Calls the `SendEmailAsync` method to send an email.
  - **await DisplayAlert(...)**: Displays an alert to the user confirming that the email has been sent successfully.

#### SendEmailAsync Method

```csharp
public async Task SendEmailAsync()
{
    if (Email.Default.IsComposeSupported)
    {
        string subject = "Hello from .NET MAUI!";
        string body = "This is a test email sent from a .NET MAUI application.";
        string[] recipients = new[] { "angelmariolmdr@gmail.com" };

        var message = new EmailMessage
        {
            Subject = subject,
            Body = body,
            BodyFormat = EmailBodyFormat.PlainText,
            To = new List<string>(recipients)
        };

        await Email.Default.ComposeAsync(message);
    }
}
```

- **SendEmailAsync**: This method handles the composition and sending of an email.
  - **Email.Default.IsComposeSupported**: Checks if the device supports composing emails.
  - **EmailMessage**: Creates a new email message with the specified subject, body, and recipients.
  - **await Email.Default.ComposeAsync(message)**: Asynchronously composes and sends the email using the default email client.
